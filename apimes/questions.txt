Assumnpotions:
The user get the messages published after his subscription.
if a user subscribes after that a message has been sent, even if there are some
users which have not consumed the messge yet the new user won't get the old message


We can create a topic in two ways:
1 sending a message
2 subscribing to it
we can subscribe to a non existing topic it will create.
We can send a message to a non existing topic it will create but
the message will be discarded as there won't be any subscribers
TOVERIFY

If a message is sent and there are no subscribers the message get lost

is the user must register to a topic before sending a message. NOTE: how to avoid
to get a user to consume the message his sent?!?
